# 1 Information Protection Program (Domain 1)

  
## 1.1 Purpose

The Cloudticity Information Security Management Program (&quot;ISMP&quot; hereafter) identifies and controls risks to Cloudticity&#39;s infrastructure, applications and data.

  
## 1.2 Scope

The scope of this Policy applies to all computing systems within Cloudticity that are supported by the Information Technology Department (&quot;IT&quot; hereafter). This body of networks, systems, and applications are referred to as IT supported systems. The ISMP is the sum of the organizational structure, policies, planning, responsibilities, procedures, and systems that accomplish the security of the IT supported systems. The ISMP utilizes results of risk assessments and penetration tests conducted on business-critical applications and infrastructure components as the basis for mitigation efforts. The controls selected to address the identified risks drive the creation of the procedures and technical standards required by the ISMP.

  
## 1.3 Strategy

The Cloudticity ISMP will be based on an accepted industry framework that is reviewed and updated as needed. The Cloudticity ISMP is based on the HITRUST CSF Framework (0101.00a1Organizational.123) and HIPAA requirements.

The ISMP strategy shall be formally documented and actively monitored, reviewed and updated to ensure program objectives continue to be met (0102.00a2Organizational.123).

Internal independent audits will be conducted at least annually to determine whether the ISMP strategy is approved by executive management, communicated to stakeholders, adequately resourced, conforms to relevant legislation or regulations and other business requirements, and adjusted as needed to ensure the program continues to meet defined objectives (0103.00a3Organizational.1234567).

The ISMP strategy will include the Information Security objectives, approach, scope, importance, goals and principles for the Cloudticity Information Security Management Program. The ISMP strategy will be communicated throughout the company to users in a form that is relevant, accessible and understandable to the intended reader, and supported by the HITRUST CSF Framework, HIPAA and other identified security controls to ensure consideration for legislative, regulatory, contractual requirements and other policy-related requirements (0113.04a1Organizational.123).

  
## 1.4 Compliance and Continuous Improvement

The ISMP will include methods and tools to monitor the effectiveness of the implementation of controls described in the previous section. Cloudticity shall conduct independent reviews of the ISMP to ensure the continuing suitability, adequacy, and effectiveness of the organization&#39;s approach to managing information security (0177.05h1Organizational.12).

The results of such independent ISMP reviews will be recorded and reported to the management official/office initiating the review; and the results must be maintained for no less than three (3) years (0178.05h1Organizational.3).

If the independent reviews identify that Cloudticity&#39;s approach and implementation to managing information security is inadequate or not compliant with the direction for information security stated within the ISMP Policy, management will take corrective action (0179.05h1Organizational.4).

  
## 1.5 Capital Planning

Capital planning and investment requests will include the resources needed to implement the security program, employ a business case, and will include Cloudticity executive management support in ensuring that the resources are available for expenditure as planned (0120.05a1Organizational.4). Security is included in the Cloudticity Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) Manual, Section Security and Privacy.

The information security capital planning and investment plan (budget) will include resources for an information security workforce improvement program that may include but is not limited to hands-on training, certifications, seminars and/or conferences (0107.02d1Organizational.1).

  
## 1.6 Risk Management

Cloudticity shall ensure that plans for security testing, training and monitoring activities are developed, implemented, maintained and reviewed for consistency within the Risk Management Program (0108.02d1Organizational.23).

  
## 1.7 Security Roles and Responsibilities

A qualified senior-level information security official shall be appointed and is responsible for ensuring security processes are in place, communicated to all stakeholders, and addresses all requirements within the ISMP. If the senior-level information security official is employed by the organization, one of its affiliates, or a third-party service, the company retains responsibility for its cybersecurity program, designate a senior member of the company responsible for direction and oversight, and require the third-party service to maintain an appropriate cybersecurity program of its own (01110.05a1Organizational.5, 0117.05a1Organizational.1).

The security officer ensures the effectiveness of the ISMP through program oversight, establishes and communicates the ISMP priorities, reviews and updates the ISMP strategy, monitors compliance to the ISMP by the workforce, and evaluates and accepts security risks on behalf of Cloudticity (0118.05a1Organizational.2, 0110.02d2Organizational.1). The responsibility for auditing information system access and activity is assigned to the security officer.

The security officer will charter aninformation security management committee that includes documented security contacts that are assigned from each major business unit (0119.05a1Organizational.3).

User security roles and responsibilities shall be clearly defined and communicated to all employees throughout Cloudticity (0104.02a1Organizational.12).

Cloudticity&#39;s management will ensure users are briefed on their security role(s)/responsibilities and conform with the terms and conditions of employment prior to obtaining access to Cloudticity&#39;s information systems. Such terms will include guidelines regarding the security expectations of their roles; principals to motivate users to comply with security policies (0109.02d1Organizational.4).

The pre-employment process shall be reviewed by recruitment to ensure security roles/responsibilities are specifically defined (in writing) and clearly communicated to job candidates (0106.02a2Organizational.23).

Risk designations shall be assigned for all positions within Cloudticity as appropriate, with commensurate screening criteria, and reviewed/revised every three hundred and sixty-five (365) days (0105.02a2Organizational.1).

  
## 1.8 Policy Management

ISMP Security Policy (this document) must always present the Cloudticity CTO&#39;s policy direction to be in line with business objectives and demonstrate management&#39;s support for, and commitment to, Information Security across the supported Cloudticity systems. The leaders responsible for the execution of the functional topics addressed in this policy must annually review and approve those sections of this policy. These reviews must be documented.

Cloudticity&#39;s Information Security Policy shall be regularly reviewed and updated to ensure they reflect leading practices (e.g., for systems and services development and acquisition), and all reviews/changes will be communicated throughout the company (0114.04b1Organizational.1).

  
## 1.9 Policy Sanctions and Acceptable Use

The company will formally address the purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities and compliance requirements for its human resources security protection program (e.g., through policy, standards, guidelines, and procedures; 0137.02a1Organizational.3).

Cloudticity will employ a formal sanctions process for personnel failing to comply with established information security policies and procedures. Such a sanctions process will notify defined personnel (e.g., supervisors) within two (2) business days. Further, the sanction process shall include specific procedures for license, registration, and certification denial or revocation and other disciplinary action (0135.02f1Organizational.56). Details on policy and procedure sanctions can be found in the Roles Process 5.1.5.

Cloudticity shall maintain a current listing of all workforce members (individuals, contractors, vendors, business partners, etc.) with access to sensitive information (e.g. PHI, and/or PII) (11219.01b1Organizational.10). Unique IDs that can be used to trace activities to the responsible individual will be required for all types of the company&#39;s and non-the company&#39;s users (1122.01q1System.1). Actions that can be performed without identification and authentication will be permitted by exception (1133.01v2System.4).

Account types will be identified (individual, shared/group, system, application, guest/anonymous, emergency and temporary), conditions for group and role membership are established, and, if used, shared/group account credentials are modified when users are removed from the group (1139.01b1System.68). User IDs assigned to vendors shall be reviewed in accordance with the company&#39;s access review policy, at a minimum annually (1177.01j2Organizational.6).

Role-based access control will be implemented and is capable of mapping each user to one or more roles, and each role to one or more system functions (1145.01c2System.1). Privileges will be formally authorized and controlled, allocated to users on a need-to-use and event-by-event basis for their functional role (e.g., user or administrator), and documented for each system product/element (1143.01c1System.123).

All file system access not explicitly required shall be disabled, and only authorized users will be permitted access to only that which is expressly required for the performance of the users&#39; job duties (1153.01c3System.35).

Access rights from an application to other applications shall be controlled (1130.01v2System.1). Access rights to applications and application functions shall be limited to the minimum necessary using menus (1129.01v1System.12). Outputs from application systems handling covered information shall be limited to the minimum necessary and sent only to authorized terminals/locations (1131.01v2System.2).

Cloudticity shall facilitate information sharing by enabling authorized users to determine a business partner&#39;s access when discretion is allowed as defined by the company and by employing manual processes or automated mechanisms to assist users in making information sharing/collaboration decisions (1149.01c2System.9).

The access control system for the system components storing, processing or transmitting covered information shall be set with a default &quot;deny-all&quot; setting (1150.01c2System.10).

  
## 11.4 Shared/Guest Accounts

Group, shared or generic accounts and passwords (e.g., for first-time log-on) will not be used (1111.01b2System.1). Shared/group and generic user IDs shall only be used in exceptional circumstances where there is a clear business benefit, when user functions do not need to be traced, additional accountability controls are implemented, and after approval by management (1124.01q1System.34).

Redundant user IDs will not be issued to other users and shall require that all users are uniquely identified and authenticated for both local and remote access to information systems (11109.01q1Organizational.57).

Non-Cloudticity users (all information system users other than the company&#39;s users, such as patients, customers, contractors, or foreign nationals), or processes acting on behalf of non-the company&#39;s users, determined to need access to information residing on the company&#39;s information systems, shall be uniquely identified and authenticated (11110.01q1Organizational.6).

  
## 11.5 Privilege Account Management

Cloudticity shall limit authorization to privileged accounts on information systems to a pre-defined subset of users (1151.01c3System.1). Users who performed privileged functions (e.g., system administration) shall use separate accounts when performing those privileged functions (1123.01q1System.2). Elevated privileges will be assigned to a different user ID from those used for normal business use, all users access privileged services in a single role, and such privileged access is minimized (1147.01c2System.456).

Replay-resistant authentication mechanisms shall be implemented such as one-time passwords, or time stamps to secure network access for privileged accounts; and, for hardware token-based authentication, employs mechanisms that satisfy minimum token requirements discussed in NIST SP 800-63-2, Electronic Authentication Guideline (11112.01q2Organizational.67).

Restriction shall apply to all access to privileged functions and all security-relevant information (1148.01c2System.78). Authorization to access specific security relevant functions (deployed in hardware, software, and firmware) and security-relevant information shall be addressed (1144.01c1System.4).

Use of programs that avoid the need to run with elevated privileges and system routines to avoid the need to grant privileges to users shall be implemented (1146.01c2System.23).

Default and unnecessary system accounts shall be removed, disabled, or otherwise secured such that the passwords are changed and privileges are reduced to the lowest levels of access. (1107.01b1System.2). Ports, services, and similar applications installed on a computer or network systems, which are not specifically required for business functionality, shall be disabled or removed (1194.01l2Organizational.2).

Cloudticity shall audit the execution of privileged functions on information systems and ensure information systems prevent non-privileged users from executing privileged functions (1152.01c3System.2).

Access to management functions or administrative consoles for systems hosting virtualized systems shall be restricted to personnel based upon the principle of least privilege and supported through technical controls (11180.01c3System.6).

  
## 11.6 Network Access Security

Network equipment will be checked for unanticipated dial-up capabilities (1119.01j2Organizational.3).

Controls for the access to diagnostic and configuration ports shall include the use of a key lock and the implementation of supporting procedures to control physical access to the port (1193.01l2Organizational.13).

When PKI-based authentication shall include validation of certificates by constructing and verifying a certification path to an accepted trust anchor, including checking certificate status information; enforces access to the corresponding private key; maps the identity to the corresponding account of the individual or group; and implements a local cache of revocation data to support path discovery and validation in case of an inability to access revocation information via the network (11111.01q2System.4).

  
## 11.7 Remote Access

Strong authentication methods such as multi-factor, Radius or Kerberos (for privileged access) and CHAP (for encryption of credentials for dialup methods) shall be implemented for all external connections to the company&#39;s network (1116.01j1Organizational.145). Multi-factor authentication methods shall be used in accordance with the company&#39;s policy, (e.g., for remote network access) (1125.01q2System.1).

All remote access shall use encryption (e.g., VPN solutions or private lines) and log remote access activity on the network by employees, contractors or third-party (e.g., vendors) (1118.01j2Organizational.124).

The company will employ multifactor authentication for network access to privileged and non-privileged accounts, such that one of the factors is provided by a device separate from the system gaining access, and for local access to privileged accounts (including those used for non-local maintenance and diagnostic sessions, 11113.01q3Organizational.1).

Remote administration sessions shall be authorized, encrypted, and employ increased security measures (1121.01j3Organizational.2). Additionally, Cloudticity shall monitor and control remote access methods (1179.01j3Organizational.1).

Unauthorized remote connections shall be monitored and reviewed at least quarterly, and appropriate action is taken if an unauthorized connection is discovered (1120.09ab3System.9).

Remote access by vendors and business partners (e.g., for remote maintenance) shall be disabled/deactivated when not in use (1117.01j1Organizational.23). Remote access to business information across public networks will only take place after successful identification and authentication (1175.01j1Organizational.8).

Node authentication, including cryptographic techniques (e.g., machine certificates), will be used as an alternative means of authenticating groups of remote users where they are connected to a secure, shared computer facility (1178.01j2Organizational.7).

Copy (including print screen), move, print, and storage of sensitive data will be prohibited when accessed remotely without a defined business need (1134.01v3System.1).

  
## 11.8 Clear Desk/Clear Screen Policy

A time-out system (e.g., a screen saver) shall pause the session screen after 2 minutes of inactivity, close network sessions after 30 minutes of inactivity, and require the user to reestablish authenticated access once the session has been paused or closed; or, if the system cannot be modified, a limited form of time-out that clears the screen but does not close down the application or network sessions is used (11126.01t1Organizational.12, 11127.01t2Organizational.1).

Computer login banners will be displayed outlining the terms and conditions of access and must be accepted before access is granted (1138.06e2Organizational.12).

Covered or critical business information shall not be left unattended or available for unauthorized individuals to access, including on desks, printers, copiers, fax machines, and computer monitors (1114.01h1Organizational.123).


# 12 Audit Logging &amp; Monitoring (Domain 12)

  
## 12.1 Audit Log Management

A secure audit record shall be created for all activities on the system (create, read, update, delete) involving covered information (1202.09aa1System.1). Audit records will include the unique user ID, unique data subject ID, function performed, and date/time the event was performed (1203.09aa1System.2).

Audit records will be retained for 90 days and older audit records are archived for one year (1207.09aa2System.4). Information collected from multiple sources shall be aggregated for review (12103.09ab1Organizational.5). The initiation of an event will be separated from its authorization to reduce the possibility of collusion (1277.09c2Organizational.4).

Audit logging procedures shall specify how often audit logs are reviewed, how the reviews are documented, and the specific roles and responsibilities of the personnel conducting the reviews, including the professional certifications or other qualifications required (12101.09ab1Organizational.3).

Retention for audit logs will be specified by the company and the logs retained accordingly (1239.09aa1System.4). Reports summarizing audit activities shall be retained for a period of six years.

  
## 12. 2 Security Incident and Event Management

Cloudticity shall provide notice that the employee&#39;s actions may be monitored, and that the employee consents to such monitoring (1201.06e1Organizational.2).

All applicable legal requirements related to monitoring authorized access and unauthorized access attempts will be met (1212.09ab1System.1).

Cloudticity shall analyze and correlate audit records across different repositories using a security information and event management (SIEM) tool or log analytics tool for log aggregation and consolidation from multiple systems/machines/devices and correlates this information with input from non-technical sources to gain and enhance company-wide situational awareness. Using the SIEM tool, the company (system administrators and security personnel) devise profiles of common events from given systems/machines/devices so that it can tune detection to focus on unusual activity, avoid false positives, more rapidly identify anomalies, and prevent overwhelming analyst with insignificant alerts (1222.09ab3System.8).

Such automated systems shall support near real-time analysis and alerting of events (e.g., malicious code, potential intrusions) and integrate intrusion detection into access and flow control mechanisms (1218.09ab3System.47).

Additionally, the SIEM shall be deployed to monitor key events and anomalous activity, and analyze system logs, the results of which are reviewed regularly (1213.09ab2System.128). The SIEM shall support audit reduction and report generation (1215.09ab2System.7). The SIEM shall be able to automatically process audit records for events of interest based on selectable criteria (1219.09ab3System.10).

The activities of privileged users (administrators, operators, etc.) shall include the success/failure of the event, time the event occurred, the account involved, the processes involved, and additional information about the event (1204.09aa1System.3).

Monitoring shall include privileged operations, authorized access or unauthorized access attempts, including attempts to access deactivated accounts, and system alerts or failures (1214.09ab2System.3456).

Monitoring shall include inbound and outbound communications and file integrity monitoring (1220.09ab3System.56).

Monitoring shall identify irregularities or anomalies that are indicators of a system malfunction or compromise and help confirm the system is functioning in an optimal, resilient and secure state (12100.09ab2System.15).

All disclosures of covered information within or outside of the company shall be logged including type of disclosure, date/time of the event, recipient, and sender (1210.09aa3System.3). Every ninety (90) days each extract of covered information recorded shall have the data is erased unless its use is still required (1211.09aa3System.4).

The company will provide a rationale for why the auditable events are deemed adequate to support after the fact investigations of security incidents and which events require auditing on a continuous basis in response to specific situations; and the listing of auditable events and supporting rational are reviewed and updated periodically within 365 days (1240.09aa2System.56).

The company will respond to physical security incidents and coordinate results of reviews and investigations with the company&#39;s incident response capability (1259.09ab2System.9).

  
## 12.3 Separation of Duties

Separation of duties shall be used to limit the risk of unauthorized or unintentional modification of information and systems (1229.09c1Organizational.1). Duties shall require separation and will define the information system access authorizations to support separation of duties; and incompatible duties are segregated across multiple users to minimize the opportunity for misuse or fraud (1278.09c2Organizational.56).

No single person will be allowed to access, modify, or use information systems without authorization or detection (1230.09c2Organizational.1). Additionally, all security audit activities shall be independent (1276.09c2Organizational.2).

# 15 Incident Management (Domain 15)

  
## 15.1 Security Incident Response

A formal security incident response program shall be established to respond, report (without fear of repercussion), escalate and treat breaches and reported security events or incidents. Organization-wide standards are specified for the time required for system administrators and other personnel to report anomalous events to the incident handling team, the mechanisms for such reporting, and the kind of information that should be included in the incident notification. This reporting includes notifying internal and external stakeholders, the appropriate community Computer Emergency Response Team, and law enforcement agencies in accordance with all legal or regulatory requirements for involving that organization in computer incidents (1505.11a1Organizational.13).

The security incident response program will prepare Cloudticity for a variety of security incidents (1516.11c1Organizational.12). The program shall include a process/mechanism to anonymously report security issues (1508.11a2Organizational.1). The program shall include an insider threat program that includes a cross-discipline insider threat incident handling team shall be implemented (1507.11a1Organizational.4). Incident response is formally managed and includes specific elements (1539.11c2Organizational.7).

The program shall include incident handling capability for security incidents that addresses (i) policy (setting corporate direction) and procedures defining roles and responsibilities; (ii) incident handling procedures (business and technical); (iii) communication; (iv) reporting and retention; and (v) references to a vulnerability management program (1561.11d2Organizational.14).

Cloudticity currently utilizes [Trend Micro Deep Security (TMDS)](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/hybrid-cloud/deep-security-for-cloud.html) to track file system integrity, monitor log data, detect rootkit access, provide intrusion detection and prevention, and provide anti-malware security. Additionally, the intrusion detection/information protection system (IDS/IPS) alerts will be utilized for reporting information security events (1512.11a2Organizational.8).

The security incident response program will formally define information security incidents and the phases of incident response; roles and responsibilities; incident handling, reporting and communication processes; third-party relationships and the handling of third-party breaches; and the supporting forensics program. The program shall formally assign job titles and duties for handling computer and network security incidents to specific individuals and identifies management personnel who will support the incident handling process by acting in key decision-making roles (1509.11a2Organizational.236).

The program will define the purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among the company&#39;s entities and compliance requirements (1518.11c2Organizational.13). The incident management plan shall be reviewed and updated annually (1587.11c2Organizational.10).

The program shall establish a point of contact for reporting information security events. This person will be made known throughout the company, always available, and able to provide adequate and timely response. A list of third-party contact information (e.g., the email addresses of their information security offices), which can be used to report a security incident will be maintained (1506.11a1Organizational.2). The point of contact will be responsible for coordinating incident responses and has the authority to direct actions required in all phases of the incident response process (1517.11c1Organizational.3).

Cloudticity shall test and/or exercise its incident response capability regularly (1589.11c1Organizational.5). Testing exercises shall be planned, coordinated, executed, and documented periodically, at least annually, using reviews, analyses, and simulations to determine incident response effectiveness. Testing includes personnel associated with the incident handling team to ensure that they understand current threats and risks, as well as their responsibilities in supporting the incident handling team (1521.11c2Organizational.56). The incident handling activities will be coordinated with any contingency planning activities (1562.11d2Organizational.2).

The information gained from the evaluation (tests) of information security incidents will be used to identify recurring or high-impact incidents and update the incident response and recovery strategy (1560.11d1Organizational.1).

Lessons learned from ongoing incident handling activities and industry developments will be included into incident response procedures, training and testing exercises, and will implement the resulting changes accordingly (1563.11d2Organizational.3). Incidents (or a sample of incidents) identified will then be reviewed to identify necessary improvement to the security controls (1515.11a3Organizational.3).

The incident response plan shall be communicated to the appropriate individuals throughout the company (1520.11c2Organizational.4).

All employees, contractors and third-party users will receive mandatory incident response training to ensure they are aware of their responsibilities to report information security events as quickly as possible. The procedure for reporting information security events, and the point(s) of contact, including the incident response team, and the contact information is published and made readily available (1511.11a2Organizational.5).
